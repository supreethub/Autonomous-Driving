# Autonomous-Driving


Autonomous driving is one of the great technical challenges of our time. The mission is to train a neural network to steer a car using only image from a single camera.

supreeth_betigeri.py contains the basic functions needed. A  method to train your neural network is created, method to predict the steering angles, and class that returns the predicted steering angles.

## Evaluation 
The code will be evaluated using evaluate.py. Performance will be evaluated by comparing the predicted steering angles to human steering angles: The performance metric is called a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

# Data:
Training data used can be downloaded from : www.welchlabs.io/unccv/autonomous_driving/data/training.zip
