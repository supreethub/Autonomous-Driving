# Autonomous-Driving


Autonomous driving is one of the great technical challenges of our time. The mission is to train a neural network to steer a car using only image from a single camera.

supreeth_betigeri.py contains the basic functions we'll need. First we'll need to create a method to train your neural network, a method to predict the steering angles, and class that returns the predicted steering angles.

## Evaluation 
The code will be evaluated using evaluate.py. Performance will be evaluated by comparing your predicted steering angles to human steering angles: The performance metric is called a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
